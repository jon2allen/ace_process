FINAL 'IDENTIFICATION' (Generated Translation Principles)
============================================================
{
  "translation_principles": [
    "Balance evocative, slightly elevated language with direct clarity to convey both poetic essence and meaning.",
    "Prioritize emotional impact, rendering grief, separation, and duty with vivid imagery and poignant phrasing, especially in climactic lines.",
    "Employ precise vocabulary and strive for conciseness, respecting the original's brevity without sacrificing emotional depth.",
    "Strategically expand phrases for clarity and emotional resonance when the original's conciseness might hinder understanding in English.",
    "Ensure the translation captures both the intimate personal sorrow and the broader national tragedy inherent in Du Fu's work.",
    "Maintain a classical tone, avoiding anachronistic idioms or overly colloquial language that would detract from the historical context."

============================================================
TRANSLATION STRATEGIES (learned from previous critiques):
1. When expanding concise Chinese phrases, explicitly guide translators on whether to prioritize narrative clarity (e.g., adding implied context), poetic abstraction (e.g., emphasizing imagery), or direct emotional statement, and stress the importance of maintaining consistency within a given translation.
2. Establish a clear and consistent romanization standard for all proper nouns (e.g., place names like Fuzhou/Fuchou, Chang'an/Ch'ang-an) to ensure uniformity and avoid reader confusion across different works or within a single collection.
3. Emphasize the critical role of verb and adjective choice in rendering vivid imagery and metaphors, as subtle differences (e.g., 'splash tears' vs. 'sprinkle tears' vs. 'draw tears') significantly impact the emotional tone and poetic quality.
4. Provide guidance on handling implied subjects and objects in Chinese poetry; translators must carefully consider the most natural and impactful way to introduce them in English, balancing clarity with conciseness and avoiding over-explanation that might detract from the original's elegance.
