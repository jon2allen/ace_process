    "ground_truth_json": "{\n  \"open_window_story\": \"Open Window by H.H Monroe or pen name Saki:\\n\\n\\\"My aunt will be down presently, Mr Nuttall\\\" said a very self-possessed young lady of 15. In the meantime, you must try and put up with me. Frampton Nuttall endeavored to say the correct something which should duly flatter the niece of the moment without unduly discounting the aunt that was to come. Privately, he doubted more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure which he was supposed to be undergoing. \\n\\nI know how it will be, his sister had said when he was preparing to migrate to this Rural Retreat. You will bury yourself down there and not speak to a living soul, and your nerves will be worse than ever from moping. I shall just give you letters of introduction to all the people I know. There, some of them as far as I can remember, were quite nice.\\n\\nFrampton wondered whether Mrs. Sappleton, the lady to whom he was presenting one of the letters of introduction, came into the nice division. Do you know many of the people around here? asked the niece when she judged that they had had sufficient silent communion. Hardly a soul, said Frampton. My sister was staying here at the rectory, you know, some four years ago, and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here. \\n\\nThen you know practically nothing about my aunt, pursued the self-possessed young lady. Only her name and address, admitted the caller. He was wondering whether Mrs. Appleton was in the married or widowed State when an undefinable something about the room seemed to suggest masculine habitation. \\n\\nHer great tragedy happened just three years ago, said the child. That would be since your sister's time. Her tragedy? asked Frampton. Somehow in this restful country spot, tragedy seemed out of place. You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an October afternoon, said the niece, indicating a large French window that opened onto a lawn. It is quite warm for the time of the year, said Frampton, but has that window got anything to do with the tragedy?\\n\\nOut through that window three years ago today, her husband and her two young brothers went off for their day's shooting. They never came back. Crossing them more to their favorite snipe shooting ground, they were all three engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog. It had been that dreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other years gave way suddenly without warning. Their bodies were never recovered. That was the dreadful part of it.\\n\\nHear the child's voice lost its self-possessed note and became falteringly human. Poor Deven she has often told me how they went out, her husband with his white waterproof coat over his arms, and Ronnie, her youngest brother, singing birdie why do you bound as he always did to tease her because she said it got on her nerves. Do you know sometimes on still quiet evenings like this, I almost get a creepy feeling that they will all walk in through that window. \\n\\nShe broke off with a little shudder. It was a relief to Frampton when the aunt bustled into the room with a whirl of apologies for being late and making her appearance. I hope Vera has been amusing you, she said. She has been very interesting, said Frampton. I hope you don't mind the open window, said Mrs. Sappleton briskly. My husband and brothers will be home directly from shooting and they always come in this way. They've been out for snipe in the marshes today so they'll make a fine mess over my poor carpets, so like you men folk, isn't it? \\n\\nShe rattled on cheerfully about the shooting and the scarcity of birds and the prospects for duck in the winter. To Frampton it was all purely horrible. He made a desperate but only partially successful effort to turn the talk onto a less ghastly topic. He was conscious that his hostess was giving him only a fragment of her attention and her eyes were constantly straying past him to the open window and the lawn beyond. \\n\\nIt was certainly an unfortunate coincidence that he should have paid his visit on this tragic anniversary. The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest, an absence of mental excitement, and avoidance of anything in the nature of violent physical exercise, announced Frampton, who labored under the tolerably widespread delusion that strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the least detail of one's ailments and infirmities, their cause and cure. On the matter of diet, they are not so much in agreement, he continued. No, said Mrs. Appleton in a voice which only replaced a yawn at the last moment. \\n\\nThen she suddenly brightened into alert attention, but not to what Frampton was saying. Here they are at last, she cried, just in time for tea, and don't they look as if they were muddy up to the eyes! Frampton shivered slightly and turned towards the niece with a look intended to convey sympathetic comprehension. The child was staring out through the open window with a dazed horror in her eyes. \\n\\nIn a chill shock of nameless fear, Frampton swung round in his seat, looked in the same direction. In the deepening twilight, three figures were walking across the lawn towards the window. They all carried guns under their arms, and one of them was additionally burned with a white coat hung over his shoulders. A tired brown spaniel kept close at their heels. Noiselessly they neared the house, and then a horse young voice chanted out of the dusk: I said birdie why don't you bound?\\n\\nFrampton grabbed wildly at his second hat, the hall door, the gravel drive, and the front gate were dimly noted stages in his headlong retreat. A cyclist coming along the road had to run into the Hedge to avoid eminent Collision. Here we are my dear, said the bearer of the white Macintosh coming in through the window, fairly muddy but most of it's dry. Who is that who bolted out as we came up? A most extraordinary man, uh Mr. Nettle, said Mrs. Sappleton. He could only talk about his illness and dashed off without a word of goodbye or apology when you arrived, one would think he had seen a ghost. I expect it was the spaniel, said the niece calmly. He told me he had a horror of dogs. He was once hunted into a cemetery somewhere on the banks of the Ganges by a pack of pariah dogs and had to spend the night in a newly dug grave with the creatures snarling and grinning and foaming just above him, enough to make anyone lose their nerve. Romance at short notice was her specialty.\"\n}",

    "ground_truth_json": "{\n  \"tiger_story\": \"Packletide's Tiger by Saki:\\n\\nIt was Mrs. Packletide's pleasure and intention that she should shoot a tiger, not that the lust to kill had suddenly descended on her or that she felt she would leave India safer and more wholesome. The compelling motive for her deviation towards the footsteps of Nimrod was the fact that Luna Bimberton had recently been carried 11 miles in an airplane by an Algerian Aviator and talked of nothing else. Only a personally procured tiger skin and a Heavy Harvest of press photographs could successfully counter that sort of thing.\\n\\nMrs. Packletide had already arranged in her mind the lunch she would give at her house in Kurzon Street, ostensibly in Luna Bimberton's honor, with a tiger skin rug occupying most of the foreground. She’d also already designed the Tiger Claw Broach she was going to give Luna Bimberton on her next birthday. \\n\\nIn a world swayed by hunger and love, Mrs. Packletide was an exception; her movements and motives were largely governed by the dislike of Luna Bimberton. Circumstances proved propitious. Mrs. Packletide had offered a thousand rupees for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without over much risk or exertion, and a neighboring village could boast of being the favored rendezvous of an animal of respectable antecedents, driven by age to abandon game killing and confine its appetite to smaller domestic animals. \\n\\nThe prospect of earning the thousand rupees had stimulated the sporting instincts of the villagers. Children were posted day and night on the outskirts of the jungle to head the tiger back, and cheaper kinds of goats were left about to keep him satisfied. The one great anxiety was lest he should die of old age before the mem sahib's shoot. Mothers hushed their singing lest they curtail the restful sleep of the venerable beast.\\n\\nThe great night arrived, moonlit and cloudless. A platform had been constructed in a comfortable tree, and there crouched Mrs. Packletide and her paid companion, Miss Mebane. A goat, gifted with a persistent bleat, was tethered at the correct distance. With a cited rifle and a thumbnail pack of patience cards, the sports women awaited the quarry.\\n\\n“I suppose we are in some danger,” said Miss Mebane, not nervous about the wild beast but dreading performing a service she’d paid for. “Nonsense,” said Mrs. Packletide, “it’s a very old tiger; it couldn’t spring up here even if it wanted to.” \\n\\n“If it’s an old tiger, I think you ought to get it cheaper. A thousand rupees is a lot of money.” Louisa Mebane adopted a protective attitude towards money, saving it from dissipation. Her speculations as to the market depreciation of tiger remnants were cut short by the appearance of the animal.\\n\\nAs soon as it caught sight of the tethered goat, it lay flat on the earth, seemingly less from a desire to take advantage of cover than for a short rest before commencing the attack. “I believe it’s ill,” said Louisa for the benefit of the village headman. “Hush,” said Mrs. Packletide, and at that moment the tiger commenced ambling towards his victim.\\n\\n“Now urge!” cried Mrs. Packletide with excitement. “He doesn’t touch the goat; we didn’t pay for it. The bait was extra!” The rifle flashed, and the great beast sprang to one side and rolled over in stillness of death. \\n\\nA crowd of excited natives swarmed onto the scene, and their shouting carried the glad news to the village, where tomtoms took up the chorus of triumph. Mrs. Packletide felt the luncheon party in Kurzon Street seemed immeasurably nearer.\\n\\nIt was Louisa Mebane who drew attention to the fact that the goat was in death throws from a mortal bullet wound, while no trace of the rifle’s deadly work could be found on the tiger. Evidently, the wrong animal had been hit, and the beast had succumbed to heart failure caused by the sudden report of the rifle and accelerated by senile decay.\\n\\nMrs. Packletide was annoyed at the discovery, but she was now a possessor of a dead tiger, and the villagers gladly connived at the fiction that she had shot the beast. Mrs. Mebane afforded Mrs. Packletide a light heart for the cameras, and her pictured fame reached from the Texas weekly snapshot to the Illustrated Monday supplement.\\n\\nAs for Luna Bimberton, she refused to look at an illustrated paper for weeks, and her letter of thanks for the gift of a tiger claw brooch was a model of repressed emotion. The tiger skin rug traveled down to the manor house and was duly inspected and admired. It seemed to fit in appropriately when Mrs. Packletide went to the county costume ball as Diana.\\n\\nShe refused to fall in with Clovis’s suggestion of a primeval dance party, where everyone should wear the skins of beasts they had recently slain. “I should be rather a Baby Bunting,” she confessed. “My figure is quite good,” Clovis added with a malicious glance.\\n\\nLouisa Mebane, a few days after the ball, quietly told Mrs. Packletide how she had shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death. “You surely wouldn’t give me away,” asked Mrs. Packletide, her face changing color. “I’ve seen a vegan cottage near Dorking that I should rather like to buy,” said Miss Mebane with seeming irrelevance. “680 Freehold, quite a bargain, only I don’t happen to have the money.”\\n\\nLouisa Mebane’s pretty weekend cottage, christened by her live foves and gay in summertime, is the wonder and admiration of her friends. It is a marvel how Louisa manages to do it, is the general verdict. Mrs. Packletide indulges in no more big game shooting; the incidental expenses are so heavy, she confides to inquiring friends.\\n\\n\"\n}",

Every detail of her sprawling estate, from the imported marble statues to the genetically engineered, non-allergenic 'perfume roses,' screamed control. Guests, a constellation of polished smiles and designer silks, drifted through the manicured gardens, their conversations a delicate weave of stock prices and discreetly managed scandals. Dr. Alistair Finch, the evening’s keynote entomologist, was an anomaly. His tweed jacket seemed a deliberate affront to the sea of haute couture, his quiet, observant gaze holding an unsettling glint when he spoke of the 'unpredictable beauty of nature.' He was here, ostensibly, to lecture on the delicate balance of ecosystems, a topic the Duchess embraced for its 'aesthetic potential.'\\n\\nDr. Finch’s speech was a masterclass in droll academicism, lulling the gilded audience into a state of polite, anticipatory boredom. He spoke of 'unseen forces,' 'inevitable equilibrium,' and the 'fragility of human-imposed order,' while the guests discreetly checked their watches, eager for the champagne and the evening’s highlight: the 'Grand Butterfly Release.' For weeks, Dr. Finch had been granted unprecedented access to the Duchess’s famed butterfly garden, a glass-domed marvel where exotic, captive-bred specimens fluttered in a climate-controlled paradise. What no one knew was that Dr. Finch had, with surgical precision, introduced a highly aggressive, native species of predatory insect – a particularly voracious strain of praying mantis – into the garden’s periphery. He had also, with equal subtlety, inoculated the Duchess’s prized 'perfume roses' with a specific fungal spore, engineered to rapidly decay the petals and release a potent, natural pheromone.\\n\\nThe moment arrived. The Duchess, a vision in emerald silk, beamed for the cameras as she approached the ornate, gilded cage. With a flourish, she unlatched the door, releasing a cloud of iridescent, 'endangered' butterflies. For a breathtaking second, they soared. Then, as if on cue, the garden erupted. The mantises, camouflaged until now, descended with brutal efficiency, a flurry of wings and snapping mandibles. The air filled with the silent, macabre dance of predator and prey. Simultaneously, the 'perfume roses' began to visibly blacken and wilt, their petals curling inward, releasing the pheromone – a subtle, almost imperceptible scent that worked its way into the guests’ finely tuned nervous systems, a disinhibiting agent disguised as a floral tragedy.\\n\\nInitial horror quickly gave way to something far more primal. The pheromone, combined with the shock of the garden’s sudden, violent collapse, began to strip away the guests’ carefully constructed veneers. A minor jostle for a canapé escalated into a sharp-tongued spat. Whispers of 'darling, your dress is simply *last season*' became outright declarations of 'you look like a gilded pig!' The polite smiles contorted into sneers, the air thick with the stench of decaying roses and raw, unvarnished animosity. Dr. Finch watched, a serene, almost beatific smile playing on his lips. The 'endangered butterflies' were merely a symbol. The true spectacle, the real 'wild nature' he sought to unleash, was the human animal.\\n\\nBut the performance wasn't quite over. The mantises, it turned out, were not merely predators. Dr. Finch had meticulously bred them to carry a dormant, highly contagious, yet non-lethal, skin parasite. This particular parasite, a microscopic marvel of his own design, thrived on human vanity, manifesting as an intense, uncontrollable itching, particularly in areas most exposed and most cherished: faces, hands, necks. As the guests, now openly squabbling and shoving, began to scratch themselves raw, their expensive silks tearing, their meticulously applied makeup smearing, their carefully constructed social masks utterly annihilated, Dr. Finch merely adjusted his spectacles. The 'Gala for the Preservation of Endangered Butterflies' had become a grotesque, itching tableau of human decay, a living, writhing satire. The wild, indifferent cruelty of nature had not just disrupted their artificial order; it had burrowed beneath their skin, exposing the raw, ugly truth of their superficiality, one furious scratch at a time.\"\n}",

Guests, a constellation of polished smiles and designer silks, drifted through the manicured gardens, their conversations a delicate weave of stock prices and discreetly managed scandals. Dr. Alistair Finch, the evening’s keynote entomologist, was an anomaly. His tweed jacket seemed a deliberate affront to the sea of haute couture, his quiet, observant gaze holding an unsettling glint when he spoke of the 'unpredictable beauty of nature.' He was here, ostensibly, to lecture on the delicate balance of ecosystems, a topic the Duchess embraced for its 'aesthetic potential.'\n\nDr. Finch’s speech was a masterclass in droll academicism, lulling the gilded audience into a state of polite, anticipatory boredom. He spoke of 'unseen forces,' 'inevitable equilibrium,' and the 'fragility of human-imposed order,' while the guests discreetly checked their watches, eager for the champagne and the evening’s highlight: the 'Grand Butterfly Release.' For weeks, Dr. Finch had been granted unprecedented access to the Duchess’s famed butterfly garden, a glass-domed marvel where exotic, captive-bred specimens fluttered in a climate-controlled paradise. What no one knew was that Dr. Finch had, with surgical precision, introduced a highly aggressive, native species of predatory insect – a particularly voracious strain of praying mantis – into the garden’s periphery. He had also, with equal subtlety, inoculated the Duchess’s prized 'perfume roses' with a specific fungal spore, engineered to rapidly decay the petals and release a potent, natural pheromone.\n\nThe moment arrived. The Duchess, a vision in emerald silk, beamed for the cameras as she approached the ornate, gilded cage. With a flourish, she unlatched the door, releasing a cloud of iridescent, 'endangered' butterflies. For a breathtaking second, they soared. Then, as if on cue, the garden erupted. The mantises, camouflaged until now, descended with brutal efficiency, a flurry of wings and snapping mandibles. The air filled with the silent, macabre dance of predator and prey. Simultaneously, the 'perfume roses' began to visibly blacken and wilt, their petals curling inward, releasing the pheromone – a subtle, almost imperceptible scent that worked its way into the guests’ finely tuned nervous systems, a disinhibiting agent disguised as a floral tragedy.\n\nInitial horror quickly gave way to something far more primal. The pheromone, combined with the shock of the garden’s sudden, violent collapse, began to strip away the guests’ carefully constructed veneers. A minor jostle for a canapé escalated into a sharp-tongued spat. Whispers of 'darling, your dress is simply *last season*' became outright declarations of 'you look like a gilded pig!' The polite smiles contorted into sneers, the air thick with the stench of decaying roses and raw, unvarnished animosity. Dr. Finch watched, a serene, almost beatific smile playing on his lips. The 'endangered butterflies' were merely a symbol. The true spectacle, the real 'wild nature' he sought to unleash, was the human animal.\n\nBut the performance wasn't quite over. The mantises, it turned out, were not merely predators. Dr. Finch had meticulously bred them to carry a dormant, highly contagious, yet non-lethal, skin parasite. This particular parasite, a microscopic marvel of his own design, thrived on human vanity, manifesting as an intense, uncontrollable itching, particularly in areas most exposed and most cherished: faces, hands, necks. As the guests, now openly squabbling and shoving, began to scratch themselves raw, their expensive silks tearing, their meticulously applied makeup smearing, their carefully constructed social masks utterly annihilated, Dr. Finch merely adjusted his spectacles. The 'Gala for the Preservation of Endangered Butterflies' had become a grotesque, itching tableau of human decay, a living, writhing satire. The wild, indifferent cruelty of nature had not just disrupted their artificial order; it had burrowed beneath their skin, exposing the raw, ugly truth of their superficiality, one furious scratch at a time."

    "ground_truth_json": "{\n  \"method_story\": \"Schartz Metterklume Method by Saki: Lady Carlotta stepped out onto the platform of the small Wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length to kill time till the train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then in the roadway beyond she saw a horse struggling with more than ample load and a corridor of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly took herself to the roadway and put a rather different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being none of her business. Only once had she put the doctrine of non-interference into practice, but one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable tree by an angry boar pig while lady Carlotta on the other side of the fence had proceeded with the watercolor sketch she was engaged on and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady on this occasion. She merely lost the train, which gave way to the first sign of impatience it had shown through the journey and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference, her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her. She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say she was coming on by another train before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an opposingly attired lady who soon to be taking a prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks.\\n\\n“Well, you must be Miss Hope, the governess, have come to meet,” said the apparition in a tone that admitted a very little argument. “Well, very well, if I must, I must,” said lady Carlotta to herself with dangerous meekness. “I am Mrs Kubara,” continued the lady, “and where, pray, is your luggage?” “It’s gone astray,” said the alleged governess, failing to fall in with the excellent rule of life that the absent are always to blame. The luggage hadn’t pointed fact behaved with perfect correctness. “I’ve just telegraphed about it,” she added with a nearer approach to truth. “Well, how provoking is Mrs Corball! These Railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night,” and she led the way to her car.\\n\\nWell, during the drive to the quarrel Mansion lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the nature of the charge that she’d been thrust upon her. She learned that Claude and Wilfred were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mold equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the 20th century. “I wish them not only to be taught,” said Mrs Corbarro, “but interested in what they learned in their history lessons. You must try to make them feel that they’re being introduced to the life stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at all meal times several days in the week. I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three. Russian! Oh, my dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.” “Well, that will not embarrass me in the least,” said lady Carlotta coldly. \\n\\nHow to use a colloquial expression, she was knocked off her perch. She is one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they’re not seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large, newly purchased and expensive car and lightly alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomforture of a patronus became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days on beholding his heaviest battle elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers. \\n\\nWell, at dinner that evening, although reinforced by her husband who usually duplicated her opinions and lent her moral support generally, Mrs Corball gained none of her lost ground. The governess not only helped herself well and truly to wine but held forth with considerable show of critical knowledge on various vintage matters concerning which the Corbarrels were no wise able to pose as authorities. Previous governesses had limited their conversation on the wine topic to a respectful and doubtless sincere expression of a preference for water. When this one went as far as to recommend a wine firm in whose hands you could not go very far wrong, Mrs Corball thought in time to turn the conversation to more usual channels. \\n\\n“We got very satisfactory references about you from Canon Teep,” she observed. “A very estimable man, I should think.” “Well, he drinks like a fish and beats his wife, but otherwise a very lovable character,” said the governess imperturbably. “My Dear Miss Hope, I trust you’re exaggerating!” exclaimed the Corbarrels in unison. “One must in justice admit that there is some provocation to continue the romancer. Mrs Teep is quite the most irritating bridge player that I’ve ever sat down with. Her leads and declarations would condone a certain amount of brutality in her partner, but to salzer at the contents of the only soda water siphon in the house on a Sunday afternoon when one couldn’t get another argues an indifference to the comfort of others which I cannot altogether overlook.” “You may think me hasting my judgments, but it’s practically on account of the siphon incident that I left.” \\n\\n“We’ll talk of this some other time,” so Mrs Kubal hastily. “Well, I shall never allude to it again,” so the governess with decision. Mr Corball made a welcome diversion by asking what studies the new instructor proposed to inaugurate on the morrow. “Well, history to begin with,” she informed him. “Ah, history,” he observed sagely. “Now, teaching them history you must take care of the interest in them and what they learned. You must make them feel that they’re being introduced to the life stories of men and women who really lived.” “I’ve told her all that,” interposed Mrs Corbarro. “I teach history on the shorts medical method,” so the governess loftily. \\n\\n“Oh, yes,” Sir Listeners thinking that expedient to assume an acquaintance at least with the name. “What are you children doing out here?” Matt and Mrs Quarrel the next morning on finding Irene sitting rather glumly at the head of the stairs while her sister was perched in an attitude of distressed discomfort on the window seat behind her with a wolf skin rug almost covering her. “We are having a history lesson,” came the unexpected reply. “I’m supposed to be Rome and Villa up there is the she-wolf, not a real wolf but the figure of one that the Romans used to set the store by. I forget why.” “Claude and Wilfred have gone to fetch the shabby women.” “Yes, they’ve got to carry them off. They didn’t want to, but Miss Hope got one of Father’s five fives bats and said she’d give them a number nine spanking if they didn’t, so they’ve gone to do it.” \\n\\nA loud angry screaming from the direction of the lawn drew Mrs Cabral thither in hot haste, fearful less the threatened castigation might even be now in the process of infliction. The outcry, however, came principally from the two small daughters of the lodge keeper who were being hauled and pushed towards the house by the panting and disheveled Claude and Wilfred, whose task was rendered even more arduous by the incessant if not very effectual attacks of the captured maiden’s smaller brother. The governess, five’s bat in hand, sat negligently on the stone balustrade presiding over the scene with the cold impartiality of a goddess of battles. A furious and repeated chorus of “Tell Mother Rose!” from the lodge children, but the lodge mother, who was hard of hearing, was for the moment immersed in the preoccupation of her wash tub. After an apprehensive glance in the direction of the lodge, the good woman was gifted with the highly militant temper which is sometimes the privilege of deafness. Mrs Corballa flew indignantly to the rescue of the struggling captives. “Wilfred, Claude, let those children go at once, Miss Hope! What on Earth is the meaning of the scene?” “Well, it’s early Roman history, the Sabine women, don’t you know? It’s the schartzmaneklu method to make children understand history by acting in themselves. It fixes it in their memory. You know, of course, if thanks to interference your boys go through life thinking that the Sabine Women ultimately escaped, I really cannot be held responsible.” \\n\\n“Well, you may be clever and modern, Miss hope,” so Mrs Corral firmly, “but I should like you to leave here by the next train. Your luggage will be sent after you as soon as it arrives.” “I’m not certain exactly where I shall be for the next few days so the dismissed instructor of Youth. You might keep my luggage till I wire my address there are only a couple of trunks and some golf clubs. Oh, and a leopard cub.” “A leopard cub!” gasped Mrs Cabarro, even in her departure this extraordinary person seemed destined to leave a trail of embarrassment behind her. “Well, it’s rather left off being a cub, it’s more half grown you know, a foul every day and a rabbit on Sundays is what it usually gets. Raw beef makes it too excitable. Don’t trouble about getting the car for me, I’m rather inclined for a walk,” and Lady Carlotta strode out of the Cabral highs horizon. \\n\\nThe advent of a genuine Miss Hope who had made a mistake as to the day on which she was due to arrive caused a turmoil which that good lady was quite unused to inspiring. Obviously the Cabral family had been woefully befooled, but a certain amount of relief came with the knowledge how tiresome for you dear Carlotta said her Hostess when the overdue guests ultimately arrived. “How very tiresome losing your train and having to stop overnight in a strange place!” “Oh dear no,” said lady Carlotta, “not at all tiresome for me.”\\n\\n\"\n}",

Her nephew, Lord Percival, a man whose self-importance was as meticulously cultivated as the orchids around them, held court beside a specially illuminated display.

Miss Elara Vance, a botanist of quiet renown, stood slightly apart, her gaze dissecting the orchid with an unnerving precision. She had been invited, ostensibly, to authenticate Percival’s grand claim, though her presence felt more like a subtle challenge to the estate’s carefully constructed reality. As Percival launched into a particularly florid account of his 'perilous expedition' – a narrative that grew more embellished with each passing year – a ripple of unease spread through the crowd.

And that particular shade of obsidian… quite the achievement in artificial pigmentation.' Blackwood paused, a faint smile touching his lips. 'And the serpent, Miss Vance?' Elara’s own smile was thin, knowing. 'A harmless garden snake, I suspect. Though the scent of a certain pheromone, easily synthesized, can make even the most docile creature appear quite menacing, especially when applied to a plant whose artificial composition would naturally attract it.' She looked at Blackwood, then back at the empty space where the orchid had been. 'Lady Seraphina, I imagine, has a rather profound understanding of both human nature and the subtle art of disruption. She despises pretense, you see. And Percival’s 'Serpent’s Kiss' was nothing if not a monument to it. A pity, really, that such a harmless creature had to be painted to expose such a venomous lie.'
