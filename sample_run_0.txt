FINAL GEMINI TRANSLATIONS (After learning)
============================================================

----------------------------------
Title: Spring Prospect (春望)
----------------------------------
The nation shattered, mountains and rivers endure;
The city in spring, its grass and trees grown deep.
Moved by the times, flowers shed tears;
Grieving separation, birds startle the heart.
Beacon fires blaze for three months on end;
A letter from home is worth ten thousand gold.
My white hair, scratched, grows shorter still,
Almost too sparse to hold a hairpin.

----------------------------------
Title: Moonlit Night (月夜)
----------------------------------
Tonight, the Fuzhou moon;
In her chamber, she watches solitary.
Distantly I pity my small children,
Unaware of longing for Chang'an.
Fragrant mist damps her cloud-tresses;
Pure light chills her jade arms.
When will we lean by the vacant curtain,
Both bathed in light, till our tear-streaks dry?

----------------------------------
Title: Gazing at Mount Tai (望岳)
----------------------------------
Mount Tai, how does it loom?
Its green, across Qi and Lu, unending.
Creation gathers all its divine splendor,
Yin and Yang cleave dusk from dawn.
Clouds rise, stirring my breast,
Through straining eyes, homing birds appear.
I must ascend its highest peak,
To see all other mountains as but small.

PROCESS STRATEGIES (learned from previous critiques):
1. Prioritize conciseness and elegance, especially when implying emotional or physical states, rather than literal descriptions.
2. Strive for vivid and evocative imagery, paying close attention to the precise nuance of verbs to convey atmosphere and emotional depth.
3. Prioritize natural English phrasing and rhythm, even if it requires rephrasing literal constructions.
4. Ensure interpretations of nuanced or abstract lines directly convey the intended meaning and integrate smoothly into the overall text, avoiding overly abstract or clunky phrasing.
5. When translating descriptions of natural phenomena or personal experience, prioritize strong, active verbs that convey dynamism and intensity.
6. For lines describing sensory experiences or concluding statements, aim for conciseness and vivid, impactful imagery, even if it requires a less literal approach.
