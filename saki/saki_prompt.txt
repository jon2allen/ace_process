Can at times subvert authority and societal norms through the use of mischievous characters, elaborate practical jokes, and a recurring motif of wild nature disrupting artificial human order. Story should blend witty, droll humor with a dark, macabre sensibility that exposes the underlying cruelty and hypocrisy of human nature.  Should be around 5000 words
